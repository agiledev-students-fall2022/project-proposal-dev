# Project Proposal

## Collaborators
Aditya Pradeep, Rayhan Ahmed

## Project Title: Resy Bot

### What and why?
Resy Bot aims to obtain reservations at popular and hard to get into restaurants. As NYC continues to open up post-pandemic, popular restaurants are harder to get reservations at, but with Resy Bot, you are able to get a reservation at any restaurant of your liking!

### For whom?
Whoever wants to get a reservation at a restaurant of their choosing.

### How?
Web app where you can select a restaurant and timing(s) of when you want to go. Resy Bot will then wait for the reservation to be open and snipe it instantly, then will email or send a text message regarding the reservation. 

### Scope
Project is reasonable for 4-6 people as the front-end is intuitive and the backend logic should be challenging enough to take time, while it does not seem to be too challenging (same idea as implementing a sneaker bot, which does not seem too difficult).
